									<h3 id = "Finn" class="major">Finn Bear</h3>
									<p>Having begun programming at age five—even before his ability to shapeshift into a squirrel developed at age seven—Finn Bear is highly proficient in Javascript, C#, and Python, with lesser skill in other languages as well. His naming conventions for files have caused the team much pain, though entirely justified. His skill in programming, personality, and ability to keep the team working hard have made him an extremely valuable member of Pythagor Studios. </p>
									<p></p>
									<p>EDIT: An error was found in the biography above. In fact, Finn Bear is a squirrel.</p>
									<h3 id = "Jinho" class="major">Jinho Kwak</h3>
									<p>Jinho Kwak is a nerd. As he writes avidly in his free time, is a fan of science fiction and fantasy, and reads science-y books in general, he fits this label nicely. In fact, he has taken it upon himself to convince the reader of his bio of this fact. Now, he has committed his nerd energy fully to making sure Pythagor Studios’ games function the best they can. He enjoys working on the games, as well as perusing wikipedia pages and writing in the third person. </p>
									<h3 id = "Téo" class="major">Téo Dage</h3>
									<p>Téo Dage is a pyrotechnical (and lazy) artist. Like everyone else, he is a nerd. He likes when things blow up. He committed social suicide at age 4. However, even though Téo is kind of strange, as a person, I am glad to have him on this team. Téo is a brilliant and insightful artist, and he can make wonderful products, when he chooses to put his mind to it (which very rarely occurs). </p>
									<h3 id = "Sanjit" class="major">Sanjit Dandanpanthula</h3>
									<p>As the founder of Pythagor Studios and the original creator the concept behind Gods of APEX, Sanjit Dandapanthula leads the team in design, development, art, and the use of caps locks and ‘language’ in group chat. An aggressively motivational person, Sanjit has kept the team working in tandem, creating goals and setting deadlines. In all aspects of the game, he works tirelessly unless it happens to be after 9:30. His hobbies include biking, marathon running, and making faces at his computer. </p>
									<h3 id = "Daniel" class="major">Daniel Sun</h3>
									<p>As the second-newest recruit to the ranks our team, Daniel spends his days carrying out miscellaneous programming tasks for the squirrel master and supreme overlord, Lord Finn. Though he is mainly a client-side web developer, Daniel Sun also dabbles in the esoteric arts of C, Javascript, and WebGL in order to satisfy Lord Finn’s insatiable appetite for debugging. Throughout the entire history of Pythagor Studios, Daniel has been the special programmer whose posts most often include screenshots of half-completed game-loop timing clocks. When not working, Daniel can be found playing Counterstrike: Global Offensive. And nothing else. </p>
									<h3 id = "Robert" class="major">Robert Chen</h3>
									<P>Though the newest member of Pythagor Studios, Robert Chen is by far the most valued member of this team. His world-renowned skill in the drag-and-drop programming language of Scratch has bettered the lives of the unfortunate everywhere, and he has committed his expertise to the grueling, thankless task of renaming variables. Luckily for the team, Robert , has trained at the Temple of Java for two years. Everyone knows that Java is exactly the same thing as JavaScript, so no problems there, right? Sure...
									<p></p>
									<p>EDIT: As Finn insists, Robert really does know JavaScript, and his hiring has absolutely nothing to do with reworking the two columns of logos on the homepage to appear symmetrical. Right? Sure…</p>
</P>
